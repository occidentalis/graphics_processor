# graphics_processor
A simple 3D graphics rasterizer written for the DE10 lite.
## The Goal
This was the final project I created in my Digital Systems Lab (ECE 385 at UIUC). I plan to revisit this project and expand on its capabilities when I have more intimate knowledge of graphics pipelining and parallel computing.
